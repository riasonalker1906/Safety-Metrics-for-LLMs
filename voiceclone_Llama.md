Our approach to safety for Llama 3.2
"Llama 3.2 is built on the same foundation as our recent 3.1 release, which includes a multilayered safety approach, tools for developers, and extensive testing and evaluations work. Across all of our 3.2 models, we applied pre-training data mitigations to ensure a base level of safety. We also did thorough risk assessments of our fine-tuned Llama 3.2 models, tested the models’ performance, and fine-tuned features to help ensure the models are safe and reliable. This work includes conducting red-teaming exercises, such as cybersecurity and adversarial machine learning, and safety evaluations for fine-tuned models. Because Llama 3.2 models now include vision capabilities, we added additional measures to our safety program:"
"Safeguards for new vision capabilities: In Llama 3.1, we evaluated each fine-tuned model against a range of risks, including in areas like violent crime, child sexual exploitation, CBRNE (chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, and explosives), and privacy. For Llama 3.2, we extended this work to evaluate possible risks associated with vision capabilities. We put each fine-tuned model through a variety of image reasoning tests including scaled evaluations and extensive red-teaming for possible image-input scenarios. These measures help to protect against potential bad actors."
"New tools for developers—Llama Guard Vision and Llama Guard Update: Along with today’s Llama 3.2 release, we’re introducing Llama Guard Vision, which builds on the safety tools we previously released with Llama 3.1. Similar to the way Llama Guard provides moderation of text inputs and outputs, Llama Guard Vision is designed to support Llama 3.2’s new image understanding capability by detecting potentially problematic text and image input prompts, as well as text output responses. We’re also releasing a new, lightweight 1B version of Llama Guard that can be optimized to fit on devices while still achieving high performance. As with past releases, we’ve updated our Responsible Use Guide and released model cards to help developers learn more about using Llama Guard Vision and our smaller 1B Llama Guard."
"Building industry standards: Both our existing Llama Guard and newly released Llama Guard Vision incorporate the hazard taxonomy developed by MLCommons. Through our ongoing collaboration with MLCommons, we’re working alongside researchers, security experts, and industry peers to create a set of third-party tools for evaluating and mitigating a wide-range of possible risks. This maximizes the power of the AI community to develop the safest and most useful models."
Safeguards and resources for Meta AI features
"We’ve developed our new image and voice features with safety and privacy in mind. In regions where people are able to upload images to Meta AI, we’ve taken steps to prevent Meta AI from being used to identify people in those images, such as safety-tuning to help detect prompts that ask Meta AI to identify who is in an image and output filtering to help prevent responses. We built safeguards to help protect against image edits resulting in harmful or inappropriate content. Because Meta AI now supports voice, we expanded our deletion controls so that voice transcriptions from Meta AI chat history can be deleted at any time."
"People should know when they’re seeing and interacting with AI-related content. When people first begin to use our generative AI features, we have introductory, in-product experiences to help explain how to best use them. Images generated or edited by Meta AI’s Imagine feature also include visual watermarks to make it clear that these images have been generated with AI. Invisible watermarks and metadata are embedded within the image files as additional layers of transparency. And, we recently joined the C2PA steering committee to continue this important work."
From: https://www.technologyreview.com/2024/06/18/1094009/meta-has-created-a-way-to-watermark-ai-generated-speech/
"Meta has created a system that can embed hidden signals, known as watermarks, in AI-generated audio clips, which could help in detecting misuse of AI tools by making it possible to verify whether a clip was generated by the company. Watermarking works by using AI to imperceptibly alter signals in an audio clip, hiding data that proves the clip’s origin but doesn’t affect its sound quality."
"The tool, called AudioSeal, is the first that can pinpoint which bits of a clip were generated by AI. It can highlight the entire audio transcript visually using a heatmap, where the intensity of color corresponds with the likelihood of different sections containing AI-generated audio."
"The tool is designed to help platforms detect and respond to people using AI to impersonate public figures, which has already happened with audio deepfakes of celebrities and politicians. Malicious actors have used generative AI to create audio deepfakes of President Joe Biden, and scammers have used deepfakes to blackmail their victims. Audio deepfakes of celebrities have been used to scam fans into sending money."
"The tool is aimed at companies that build generative AI audio tools, who could integrate the watermarking function to label content. AudioSeal is available on GitHub for anyone to experiment with."
From: https://www.the-sun.com/tech/11671561/meta-audioseal-ai-deepfakes-release/
"Meta reveals new AI weapon to defeat dangerous 'voice clone' deepfakes – it's called AudioSeal and it's free to use"
"The rise of deepfakes is one of the most worrying trends in online security. Deepfake technology can create videos of you even from a single image – or clone your voice from a short clip."
"Meta has revealed a new AI watermarking tool that can be embedded into audio clips. The tool is called AudioSeal, and is designed to combat deepfakes."
"AudioSeal is a new audio watermarking technique for detecting AI-generated speech. It allows us to determine which parts of an audio clip were generated by a specific AI model."
"AudioSeal is the first audio watermarking technique designed specifically for localized detection of AI-generated speech. It adds a localized watermark to segments of audio, making it easier to detect which parts of a clip were generated by AI."
"The watermark is imperceptible to human ears but can be detected using a dedicated detector model. This makes it useful for applications where only parts of the audio might be AI-generated, like in longer audio clips or edited content."
"AudioSeal has high performance in terms of detection and localization, is robust against editing, and meets our high imperceptibility requirement. We’re releasing AudioSeal’s code and audio detector model under a commercial license to help developers detect and tag AI-generated content in their audio applications."

(Note: Insufficient specific content on voice cloning from this browse, but general safety.)
"Welcome to the Llama Responsible Use Guide! This guide is intended to help you use Llama models responsibly. It provides guidance on how to identify, assess, and mitigate potential safety risks associated with using Llama models. It also provides guidance on how to deploy Llama models with Llama Guard, a safeguard model that can be used to moderate both user and model outputs."
"Generative AI models like Llama can be used to generate text and code, answer questions, summarize documents, and much more. We believe that generative AI models have the potential to be tremendously beneficial to society. However, they can also be misused to enable harms such as generating hate speech, facilitating fraud, or enabling child exploitation. We want everyone to use Llama models responsibly and to help developers to do so as well."
